# Responsive Navigation Bar

This is a simple, responsive navigation bar that collapses into a hamburger menu on mobile devices and expands back into a horizontal navigation on larger screens. It is built using **HTML**, **CSS** (with Flexbox), and **JavaScript** to ensure it works across different screen sizes while maintaining a user-friendly interface.

## Features
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes with a hamburger menu for mobile views.
- **Flexbox Layout**: Clean and efficient alignment of items.
- **Minimal JavaScript**: Uses a simple toggle mechanism for showing and hiding the menu.
- **Hover Effects**: Provides better user experience with interactive link states.
- **Accessible**: The navigation links are semantic, making them easier to understand for screen readers.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: Provides the basic structure of the navigation bar.
- **CSS3**: 
  - **Flexbox** is used for layout and alignment.
  - Media queries ensure responsive behavior.
  - Hover effects add a layer of interactivity.
- **JavaScript**: A small script to toggle the visibility of the navigation menu on mobile devices.

## File Structure



## How It Works
1. **Desktop View**: 
   - The navigation bar is displayed horizontally, with links laid out next to the brand logo.
   - Links have a hover effect that changes their color to provide visual feedback.

2. **Mobile View**: 
   - The navigation bar switches to a hamburger menu for smaller screens (below 768px width).
   - When the hamburger icon is clicked, the navigation links are displayed in a vertical dropdown.
   - The dropdown can be toggled on and off using a simple JavaScript function.
